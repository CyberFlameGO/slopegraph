# Tufte-Inspired Slopegraphs in R #

This repository holds some working code for creating Slopegraphs in R. The code shows two examples using the GNP and cancer survival data described [here](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk).

This is very much a work in progress. Pull requests welcome. Once it's more stable, this will become a full-fledged R package.

Here is the current output:
